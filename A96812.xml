         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Put your Hook through the middle part of the Gentle, and no more, then he will live longeſt; I mean through the ſkin and no more; but if you could get ſome Oyl of Ivy, that is rightly taken from the Tree in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and caſt but two drops of it among the Gentles before you uſe them, you would have ſport beyond expectation.</p>

                     <head>When to drag upon the Ground, and when not.</head>
                     <p>When you fiſh in a quick Stream drag a Quils length, or more.</p>
                     <p>Alſo when the water is not clear, but of a white or clay colour, and if you put a little piece of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let a little above the Hook, the fiſh will ſee the bait the better.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes when you are at the ſport the Wind ariſeth, and makes your Float dance upon the waves, then always obſerve, and watch well the motion of your float under water, and not the top of your Float.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw an Angler whipping for Bleaks and Dace with a <hi>May</hi>-flie, but he put on a Gentle upon the Hook beſides, and he had excellent ſport.</p>

                     <p>There are ſeveral other ways to take Pikes, there is a way to take a Pike, which is called the Snap, for which Angling you muſt have a pretty ſtrong Rod, for you muſt Angle with a Line no longer than your Rod, which muſt he very ſtrong, that you may hold the fiſh to it; your Hook muſt be a double Hook, made of a large wyre, and Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wyre one or two links long; you muſt bait the Fiſh with the Head upwards, and the point muſt come forth of his ſide a little above his vent.</p>
                     <p>In all your baitings for a Pike, you muſt enter the Needle where the point cometh forth, ſo draw your Arming through, until the Hook lyeth as you think fit, then make it faſt with a thread to the wyre, but firſt tye the thread about the wyre, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the fiſh will ſkip up and down, ſo fall to work: The bait muſt be a Gudgeon, a ſmall Trout, Roch, or Dace.</p>
                     <p>Now I will pawn my Credit, that I will ſhew a way, either in Ware, Pond, or River that ſhall take more Pikes than any Trouler ſhall do by Trouling; and it is this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt take a forked ſtick, a line of twelve Yards long wound upon it, at the lower end leave a Yard to tye, either a bunch of flaggs, or a Bladder; to Buoy up the Fiſh, to carry the bait from the Ground, that the fiſh may ſwim clear, the bait muſt be alive, either a ſmall Trout, Gudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Roch, or Dace, the forked ſtick muſt have a ſlit on the one ſide of the fork to put the Line in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:172433:62"/> that the live fiſh may ſwim at the gauge you ſet the fiſh to ſwim at, that when the Pike takes the bait, the Pike may have the full liberty of the Line for his feed; you may turn as you pleaſe of theſe looſe in the Pond or River all day long, the more the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and do it in a pond-wind: the Hooks muſt be double Hooks.</p>

                     <p>But I judge the baiting with a live fiſh is done far better, as it is done, baiting with a Minew to fiſh for a Trout.</p>

                     <p>When you troul, the head of the fiſh muſt be downward at the bent of the Hook, but when you Snap, the head muſt be upward at the Shank of the Hook.</p>
                     <p>If you fiſh at a Snap for a Pike, give him leave to run a little before you ſtrike, and then ſtrike the contrary way he runs.</p>
